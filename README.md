### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Andrew (aka @upsidedowntoast)

Iâ€™m a hardware and embedded systems engineer currently working as a Product Architect in R&D. I specialize in building high-reliability biometric and optoelectronic systems that integrate tightly across hardware, firmware, and software. I enjoy being the engineer in a room full of creativesâ€”or the creative in a room full of engineers.

In my spare time, I retrofit vintage electronics (mostly cameras) with modern embedded hardware to create functional restorations that blend analog charm with digital precision.

### ðŸ”§ What I Work On
- System architecture for optoelectronic devices  
- Embedded firmware for microcontroller, ARM, and FPGA platforms  
- Custom PCB layout and hardware bring-up  
- Optical and imaging system evaluations  
- Software quality assurance with GTest, JUnit, and automation tools  
- Industrial design and rapid prototyping  

### ðŸ“š Currently Exploring
- USB device library development for microcontrollers  
- PlatformIO toolchains (Arduino, STM32)  
- LED light pipe design and optical diffusion  

### ðŸ§ª Side Projects
- Refurbishing vintage electronics with modern components:
  - **Kodak Brownie** box cameras retrofitted with embedded microcontrollers and sensors  
  - **Dual 1019** turntable restoration with modernized mechanical and electrical systems  
  - **Model T** hardware retrofits for enhanced functionality and display  
  - **Burroughs Arithmometer** lighting retrofit using LED diffusers and custom glass elements  
- Capturing film photography in the Arizona desert using restored analog gear
